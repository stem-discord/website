# Branch is pretty stable. Just do npm install and everything should work pretty fine. **Make sure you have vue cli installed**

# quick start and help with front end

if you dont have key and cert, set `NO_HTTPS` on your `.env` file to true
do `npm run serve` and vue cli will launch a front end hot reload server. its pretty much out of the box.  
if you want to do some fancy stuff, read below

# im bored what do i do?

ctrl+f -> all documents -> "TODO" and "FIXME"

# node

uses `v15.5.0`. all other module dependencies only work with `v15`. if you project doesn't work just delete `node_modules` and abuse npm

# express

this project uses express as backend. if you want to run this server WITH the backend, `do npm run express`  
make sure to run `npm run build` so vue can build files to `./dist/`
